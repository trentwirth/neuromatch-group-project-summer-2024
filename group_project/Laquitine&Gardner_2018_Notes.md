Abstract clarification:

I wasn't sure what this sentence meant; "We found that despite excellent agreement of estimates mean and variability with a Basic Bayesian observer model, the estimate distributions were bimodal with unpre- dicted modes near the prior and the likelihood." 

This snippet I think clears it up:
> “The estimate distributions were bimodal with unpredicted modes near the prior and the likelihood”: Despite the model’s success in predicting the general trends of the estimates, the actual distribution of those estimates—how they spread out across possible values—showed a pattern that the model did not predict. Instead of showing a single peak (unimodal distribution) that would suggest a smooth integration of prior knowledge and sensory evidence, the distributions were bimodal. This means there were two peaks in the distributions of estimates. One peak was near the value dictated by the prior knowledge, and another near the sensory evidence itself. This bimodality suggests that rather than integrating the two sources of information, participants might have been switching between relying on prior knowledge and relying directly on the sensory evidence, depending on the trial.

"Switching observer model" -> a model that switches between a Basic Bayesian observer and a model that is driven by the sensory information on a given trial.

I'm curious what their model "that exclusively relied on sensory likelihood" looks like.

How would you be able to demonstrate that the prior set *is not* learned?

If we plot the error from the sensory information vs. the error from the global mean across trials, we might be able to see if participants are learning

# Research Questions

1. Can we recreate their models?
2. Question Trent has: A heuristic model that then transitions to a bayesian one might provide the best description of behavior, but it doesn't explain the "why" of the behavioral bimodality. A why model here would be really cool, especially because it might be able to inform a new "how" model...
3. Behavioral research question Trent has: would this experiment work differently if the motion was presented exclusively in the periphery?
