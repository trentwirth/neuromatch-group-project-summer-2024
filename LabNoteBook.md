Goal for day 1:
- get to know our groups
- choose a dataset
- brainstorm and search the literature for interesting papers

For the rest of week 1, we will conduct preliminary analyses of the datasets with the goal of refining and informing our research qeustion

by week 2 day 1, we will learn a general strategy for approaching a research project

> Note: I struggled a bit today remembering linear algebra; I'll need to go back and do that refresher!

Day 3/4:
Regularization:
- Use L1 regularization to select features, by setting some coefficients to zero
- Use L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, by penalizing large coefficients (reducing the weight of the coefficients across all features)
